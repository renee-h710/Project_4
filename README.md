## Real Estate Data Summary
In the midst of another housing crisis, with prices and rates continuing to skyrocket, it is a topic on many peopleâ€™s minds. Specifically, we will focus on the following areas: home value, rent percentage, and highest and lowest median housing price in 2021. We additionally predicted housing prices based on certain features and certain areas using supervised machine learning regression models. 

## Housing Values
This will reflect how many houses there are per cost bracket for each state. There is a drop down menu so the user can choose which state to view the data in a bar cart format.

## Gross Rent as Percentage of Household Income
This will reflect the average percentage of household income is used towards rent. As you hover over each state, you will be able to view that statistic.
