## Real Estate Data Summary
In the midst of another housing crisis, with prices and rates continuing to skyrocket, it is a topic on many peopleâ€™s minds. Specifically, we will focus on the following areas: home value, rent percentage, and highest and lowest median housing price in 2021. We additionally predicted housing prices based on certain features and certain areas using supervised machine learning regression models. 

## Housing Values
This reflects how many houses there are per cost bracket for each state. There is a drop down menu so the user can choose which state to view the data in a bar cart format.
